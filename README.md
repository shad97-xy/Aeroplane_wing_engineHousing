Generic Aircraft Wing with Engine Housing and Propeller Blade including the fuselage

For the design of an airplane body, wing, and engine housing in CATIA V5, surface modeling was employed 
using the Hybrid Shape Factory in Pycatia (Python library). This process involved the utilization of various 
surface sketches, including splines, polylines, circles, and cylinders. Key features such as loft, sweep, and 
revolve were implemented to extrude complex shapes. Additionally, operations like mirroring, creating 
reference planes, applying colors, and establishing circular patterns were utilized to enhance the design
